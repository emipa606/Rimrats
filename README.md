Update of Oblivionburns mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732346254

- Updated the texture, since that was requested
- Rewrote the biome-defs and thinktree to patches instead
- The rimrats will now only attack power-cables and not buildings since that seemed what the original mod tried to do
- Moved the attack-action lower in the thinktree, rimrats will now flee, eat and other basic tasks before attacking cables
- Tame rimrats will not attack cables

Rimrats are a native animal to the rimworlds and pre-date the wars that had taken place there. During the wars, rimrats were used in experiments to produce bioengineered weapons that would run into enemy territory and explode upon death (now commonly known as the 'boomrats'). Unlike their boomrat counterparts, rimrats still die in a natural fashion and only pose a minor threat as 'pests' with a mischievous curiosity for electrical wires.
